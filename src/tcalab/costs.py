"""Execution cost model: taker fee + half-spread + square-root impact,
plus funding accrual by position leg.

All components are per-unit-of-traded-notional except funding, which accrues
on HELD notional at each funding timestamp. Longs pay positive funding,
shorts receive it — first-order P&L for a perp long-short and the single most
common omission in retail crypto backtests (HANDOFF §2).

The impact coefficient defaults to the literature square-root law; §10 of the
handoff replaces it with a tape-calibrated venue estimate + CI later. The
model is deliberately a pure function of PIT-known quantities: sigma and
dollar_volume are decision-date values, never future ones.
